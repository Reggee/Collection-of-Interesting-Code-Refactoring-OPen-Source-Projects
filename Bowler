 ## Bowler 
 * Bowler is a refactoring tool for manipulating Python at the syntax tree level. It enables safe, large scale code modifications while guaranteeing that the resulting code compiles and runs. It provides both a simple command line interface and a fluent API in Python for generating complex code modifications in code.

Bowler uses a "fluent" Query API to build refactoring scripts through a series of selectors, filters, and modifiers. Many simple modifications are already possible using the existing API, but you can also provide custom selectors, filters, and modifiers as needed to build more complex or custom refactorings.
