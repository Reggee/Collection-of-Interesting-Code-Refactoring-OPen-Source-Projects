Py-Spy is a sampling profiler for Python programs. It lets you visualize what your Python program is spending time on without restarting the program or modifying the code in any way. Py-Spy is extremely low overhead: it is written in Rust for speed and doesn't run in the same process as the profiled Python program, nor does it interrupt the running program in any way. This means Py-Spy is safe to use against production Python code.
